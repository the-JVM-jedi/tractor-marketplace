- **Challenges**: 
                    - We faced a major problem using versioning with github as one of us merged their workk to the master branch prematurely
                      we had to fix this by manually removing and adding files then finally pushing them all to the dev and main branches enabling us to have a working whole again.
                    - We also faced a major issue pushing the code to vercel via the cli mainly because we were not pushing the    environment variables but once we learnt how to add the variable it still did not work as the next js build had an issue which was not so clear at first but it was because of how we managed server and client components.
                    - We also faced a lot of issue with caching in next js as it aut
- **Lessons Learned**: 
                    - One that directus is a really awesome and cool CMS that can get a lot done quite easily
                    - We learnt to use git better for versioning.
                    - We also learnt how next js works at a closer perspective.
